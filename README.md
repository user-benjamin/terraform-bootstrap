# Using an S3 Backend for Terraform State

## Overview
To enable remote state storage and collaboration, this repository is configured to use an **AWS S3 bucket** as the Terraform backend. Additionally, a **DynamoDB table** is used for state locking to prevent conflicts when multiple users run Terraform simultaneously.

---

## Prerequisites
Before using the S3 backend, ensure you have:
- **AWS CLI installed** ([Install Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html))
- **AWS credentials configured** (`aws configure`)
- **Terraform installed** ([Install Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started/install-cli))

---

## 1. Backend Configuration
### **Terraform `backend` block**
Each Terraform project should include a `backend.tf` file specifying the remote backend:

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "s3" {
    bucket         = "my-terraform-state-bucket"
    key            = "repo-name/dev/terraform.tfstate"
    region         = "us-east-1"
    encrypt        = true
    dynamodb_table = "terraform-lock-table"
  }
}
```

- **`bucket`**: Name of the S3 bucket storing Terraform state.
- **`key`**: Unique path for the state file (per repo and environment).
- **`region`**: AWS region where the bucket is created.
- **`encrypt`**: Ensures state is encrypted at rest.
- **`dynamodb_table`**: Enables state locking to prevent conflicts.

---

## 2. Initializing the Backend
Before running Terraform, **initialize the backend**:
```sh
terraform init
```

- This command downloads required providers and configures the backend.
- If the backend is already initialized, Terraform will check for state file changes.

---

## 3. Working with Terraform State

### **Checking the Current State**
To see the current Terraform state stored in S3:
```sh
terraform state list
```

### **Pulling the Remote State File**
If you need to manually download the latest state file:
```sh
terraform state pull
```

### **Forcing a State Unlock** *(Use with caution!)*
If Terraform gets stuck due to a lock, you can manually unlock it:
```sh
terraform force-unlock <LOCK_ID>
```
Find the `LOCK_ID` in the DynamoDB table associated with the backend.

---

## 4. Deleting the S3 Bucket (If Needed)
If you need to delete the Terraform state bucket, ensure you **empty it first**:
```sh
aws s3 rb s3://my-terraform-state-bucket --force
```
This command:
âœ… **Deletes all objects** in the bucket  
âœ… **Removes the bucket itself**

---

## 5. Best Practices
âœ… **Use different paths (`key`) for different environments** (e.g., `dev`, `staging`, `prod`).
âœ… **Restrict IAM access** to the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table.
âœ… **Enable versioning** on the S3 bucket to track changes to the state file.
âœ… **Always run `terraform init` after modifying the backend configuration.**
